I'm interested in platform programming, database management systems, and distributed systems. When not working on technical projects, I enjoy hiking, trail running and cross-fit 🏋🏼.

If you have any questions or if there's anything I can help with, feel free to reach out to me by [email](mailto:stamencho.bogdanovski@gmail.com). I'm always happy to connect and collaborate with others.
